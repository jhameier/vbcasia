A project for signing students in and out at church events.

This project is a work in progress. I started this in the spring of 2015 and worked on it throughout the summer. I now have some additional free time to work on it this summer (2016) and I am hopeful to get this completed this year or at least have enough functionality to utilize it. This is a custom application for tracing events at my church and signing students in and out as well as  tracking account information.

The original application was to have a java front end with database support running an internal SQL server.
  This server will more and likely be a Apache Derby server embedded in the desktop application. This will  allow the manager to have more control over creating events and making changes and updates to student accounts.
  
The secondary application will be an Android application targeting a 10" tablet so that students can be signed in and out during events. These transactions will be immediately uploaded to the database so that multiple tablets can be used simultaneously and any information entered into one table should be available to the other.
